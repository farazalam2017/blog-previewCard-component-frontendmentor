## Acknowledgments

First and foremost, I thank Allah, who has blessed me with a good life, wonderful parents, and a supportive environment to learn and grow through all the ups and downs of life. Remember, all of us are destined to leave this world one day. Before that day comes, strive to do something meaningful â€” something that makes those who remain proud and benefits humanity. Let the tree you plant bear sweet fruits for others, and may you be remembered with a smiling face in the hereafter. A special thanks to the person who created such a wonderful platform for helping us practice and improve ourselves.
